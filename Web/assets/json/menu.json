          "text":"Peter Cuong Franklin is a Vietnamese-American chef who was born and raised in Dalat in central Vietnam and trained at prestigious Le Cordon Bleu and world-famous restaurants including Caprice in Hong Kong, Alinea in Chicago. A pioneer in modern Vietnamese and Asian cuisine, he is one of the most recognizable faces on the country’s dynamic gastronomic scene. His true culinary inspiration is his mother, who runs a small noodle shop in Dalat in central Vietnam and is famed for her Nem Nướng grilled pork sausage and Mì Quảng prawn & pork turmeric noodle soup.
